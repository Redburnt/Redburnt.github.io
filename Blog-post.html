            <p><h3>Introduction:</h3>
            Hi, My name is Rajuno Ekoh and this is my very-first-blog-post.
             This is all made possible through the knowledge of web development. 
             <br> As you would have guess right, this  blog is all about me and my life. 
             To make it clear to anyone who reads this am talking about goals, <br>
            aspirations, milestones, achievements, dreams, - am joking, thats too far, 
            but it should include that to.
            it is like a diary, right? <br>My own little corner of the internet. So if you wanna get personal, know everything about me, you come here and get it all. </p>
            <p><h3>Why:</h3> To simply put this, its a learning project to practice what i've learnt.
            so web development, front-end, back-end, whatever the case may be, <br>its a good idea to get to working immediately to use the knowledge you gained all while looking for areas where your confused or
            just<br> don't know what to do and you can read specifically on those areas closing the gap between you and mastery. </p>
            <p><h3>What now?</h3>
            Starting from today I'll be uploading content, improving on this. It's going to be like a diary and we all know what a diary is like, yh "juicy". <br>
            It's your entertainment and educational gain at my expense. Have fun.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p><h3>But how possible is it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Why wont it be?<br>
                It's even dumb to think it wont now and i've been in that camp for a long while now.<br>
            we have all these websites popping up all the time, why wont it be easy for me to h-<br>
            ave one thats mine- thats how i like to view the matter. Its like freshly baked bread.<br>
            So consider this one my own bakery soon to release some exquisite types of bread<br>
             for your consumption.
            </li>
            <br>
                <li>Might change the name!<br>
                    I like the sound of the word "bakery", it fits well with what i hav planned for the b-<br>
                    log. Maybe on the next post ill even change the name to "The online bakery". 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Host! anyone?<br>
                    With the help of git I'll this wont just be a dream but one that becomes reality. I fo<br>
                    und out its possible to host a site through git-hub and thats exactly what am gonna<br>
                    do. Fabulous idea, i know. Thank-you.
