            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, My name is Rajuno Ekoh and this is my very first blog post.
                This is all made possible through the knowledge of web development. 
                As you might have guessed, this blog is all about me and my life.
                I'll talk about goals, aspirations, milestones, achievements, dreamsâ€”just kidding, that's too far, but it should include those too.
                It is like a diary, right? My own little corner of the internet. So if you want to get personal and know everything about me, you can come here and get it all.

            <h3>Why:</h3>
            <p>
                To put it simply, this is a learning project to practice what I've learnt.
                Whether it's web development, front-end, back-end, or whatever the case may be,
                it's a good idea to start working immediately to use the knowledge you gained while looking for areas where you're confused or don't know what to do. You can then read specifically on those areas, closing the gap between you and mastery.

            <h3>What now?</h3>
            <p>
                Starting today, I'll be uploading content and improving on this. It's going to be like a diary, and we all know what a diary is like, right? "Juicy".
                It's your entertainment and educational gain at my expense. Have fun.

            <h3>But how possible is it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Why won't it be? It's even dumb to think it won't be. I've been in that camp for a long while now.
                    We have all these websites popping up all the time, so why wouldn't it be easy for me to have one that's mine? That's how I like to view the matter. It's like freshly baked bread. So consider this one my own bakery soon to release some exquisite types of bread for your consumption.
                </li>
                <li>Might change the name! I like the sound of the word "bakery"; it fits well with what I have planned for the blog. Maybe on the next post, I'll even change the name to "The Online Bakery".
                </li>
                <li>Host! Anyone? With the help of Git, this won't just be a dream but one that becomes reality. I found out it's possible to host a site through GitHub, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Fabulous idea, I know. Thank you.
                </li>
